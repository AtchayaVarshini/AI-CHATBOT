ü§ñ AI Chatbot using Python
üîç Project Description
This project is an AI-powered Chatbot built using Python, designed to simulate human-like conversations and provide automated responses to user queries. It uses fundamental concepts of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and pattern recognition to understand user input and generate relevant replies.

Developed during my Python programming internship, this project showcases my ability to work with machine learning tools, data preprocessing, and user interaction logic.

üí° Key Features
Understands and responds to basic text queries

Implements rule-based and keyword-matching logic

Can be extended using NLP libraries (like nltk, spaCy, transformers)

Supports looped conversations with a graceful exit

Clean, modular, and beginner-friendly Python code

üõ† Tech Stack
Language: Python 3.x

Libraries Used:

nltk or re (for text processing)

json or pickle (for chatbot training data)

(Optional) transformers, tensorflow for advanced AI models
